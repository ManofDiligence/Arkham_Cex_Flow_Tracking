# Arkham_Cex_Flow_Tracking

### Current state: This project is to use Arkham Intelligence API to track 1h, 4h, 12h, and 3d of netflow of some well-known tokens of centralized crypto exchanges, and to send a alert to the telegram channel if any huge (>=10000000 usd) flow is detected.

#### Netflow is not the traditional way to calculate it, it's unlike the way stock market to calculate it.
#### The inflow in cryptos market is the flow of user transferring their tokens from their hot wallet to the exchanges. (it is a sell activity)
#### The outflow is the flow of user transferring their tokens from their exchanges to their hot wallet. (it is a buy and hold activity)

### Future plan: Generate a chart to show the netflow of the tokens instead of just a text message, and to add more tokens to the tracking list
