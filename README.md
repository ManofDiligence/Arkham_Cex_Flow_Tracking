# Arkham_Cex_Flow_Tracking

## Current state: This project is to use Arkham Intelligence API to track 1h, 4h, 12h, and 3d of netflow of some well-known tokens of centralized crypto exchanges, 
## and to send a alert to the telegram channel if any huge (>=10000000 usd) flow is detected.

## Future plan: Generate a chart to show the netflow of the tokens instead of just a text message, and to add more tokens to the tracking list
